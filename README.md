<h1>Challenge iFood</h1>
This project is part of my Associate Degree in Systems Analysis and Development at FIAP and was proposed as a group challenge in partnership between iFood and my college. The project involves developing a secure web back-office solution for iFood partners in the financial sector, allowing them to efficiently manage their digital account transactions, with features like balance inquiries, transaction histories, and payment management.<br><br>
